<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About

This app is a simple shop "add to cart" flow, to show the use of global state management with Redux and Redux-Saga libs in React Native.

### Main technologies

Abaixo segue o que foi utilizado na criação deste template:

- [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/) is a framework that allows the development of native mobile apps with JavaScript.
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) is a library used for navigate between app's screens
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) is a Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/): Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
  - [Redux Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/): is a library that aims to make application side effects (i.e. asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) easier to manage, more efficient to execute, easy to test, and better at handling failures.
